## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt about a CSS pseudo-element called marker and how to use it in styling list items

```css
li::marker {
  font-weight: 700;
  color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}
```

### Continued development

I need to develop myself on how and when to use absolute or relative CSS units.
